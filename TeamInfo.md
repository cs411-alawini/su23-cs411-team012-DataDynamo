## Project Summary
Our project will serve as a personalized Treatment recommender where the user will input their personalized information such as their ID, age, sex, conditions, and country and our application will provide the user with personalized info regarding treatments such as recommending certain products or certain actions to take in order to reduce their symptoms and alleviate the pain caused by their conditions. The data contains information about chronic illnesses based on user-inputted information that specifies the condition the user has, the treatment they use, and the symptoms they are experiencing. It also notes user-info like age, sex, and country.
We will get this data from the Chronic illness: symptoms, treatments and triggers dataset on Kaggle. The database contains data from May 2015 to December 2019. It has 7.98 million entries.
